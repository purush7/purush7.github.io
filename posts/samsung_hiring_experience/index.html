  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Today, I want to share the whole interview process of SRIB, I went through.</p>
<p>It started in June 2022 with a call from a 3rd party consultant after a long break.
He called me on behalf of Samsung Research and Development Institute of Bangalore. He was
interested in my naukri profile.</p>
<p>They conducted the test on 18th June. I did just average, some of the testcases
didn&rsquo;t pass TLE :( (I don&rsquo;t remember the time and memory constraints)</p>
<pre><code>Given the set of rod lengths (duplicates are allowed). I need to find two disjoint
subsets with same sum and need to maximize the sum. I just need to output the maximum
sum.
Example:  {1,2,3,4}. The subsets can be {1,3} and {4}; {1,4} and {2,3}. 
Here output should be 5
</code></pre><p>They gave me a chance to retake the test on 25th June. This time, I have cleared the test:)</p>
<pre><code>Assume Top-left corner as 0,0 and x-axis on horizontal and y-axis vertically.
The input will be the n plot co-ordinates(top left corner and bottom right). Here all
the plots are in rectangle shape and they may share the same edge but there won't be 
any overlapping area. We need to find the maximum possible square plot size that can 
be formed by these n plots such that
i)    There shouldn't be any area inside the square which isn't among the n plots.
ii)   There shouldn't be any plot such that only a part of it is inside the square.
</code></pre><p>Finally, I got an amazon voucher worth of 5000 for clearing the test and a suprise interview on 29th
June.</p>
<pre><code>- Asked me about JS
- OOP
- Implementing Stack using Linked list
- My work experience at previous companies
- Data Structures Stack vs queue, hashmap vs trie, array vs linkedlist ....
</code></pre><p>Result: Passed</p>
<p>It seems the JS is mandatory for the role, there are interviewing and I didn&rsquo;t have much experience.
I asked the recuriter before the interview about the JD and he didn&rsquo;t shared it and said he too
didn&rsquo;t know. The role I was interviewed is for Voice Intelligence team(I asked the interviewer at
end of interview)</p>
<p>Take-aways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should know the JD well</li>
<li>Mock Interview (would have improved my performance)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then recruiter called me on 30th June and he scheduled a meet on 1st July with HR. I expected the
meet will be on behaviorial,my work experience, discussing about package, and the joining date.</p>
<pre><code>- Asked me about my work experiences
- Issues I faced in my prev work
- 3 Toughest challengers I faced in work
- 3 things I liked in my prev company
- My proudest moment in my prev company
- My career goals and interests
- Higher Education
- When can I join?
- Expected package?
</code></pre><p>Result: Passed</p>
<p>It seems it went well, atleast I am statisfied with it.</p>
<p>Finally, the recruiter called me on 4th July and scheduled an interview with <code>Voice Intelligence</code>
Team Director on 5th July.</p>
<pre><code>- Asked about my work experiences
- My interests and domain I like
- Describe the role and the responsibilities
- He thought my interests won't allign with the role and said he will let me know  
after some internal discussion with the team.
</code></pre><p>Finally I was <code>ghosted</code>. The recruiter should have shared the JD and he should have given the choice
as there are many teams which are hiring inside SRIB. Thanks to the recruiter, now I am not able to
reach them.</p>
<pre><code></code></pre>
