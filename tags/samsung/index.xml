      <description>Hi,
Today, I want to share the whole interview process of SRIB, I went through.
It started in June 2022 with a call from a 3rd party consultant after a long break. He called me on behalf of Samsung Research and Development Institute of Bangalore. He was interested in my naukri profile.
They conducted the test on 18th June. I did just average, some of the testcases didn&amp;rsquo;t pass TLE :( (I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the time and memory constraints)</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to share the whole interview process of SRIB, I went through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started in June 2022 with a call from a 3rd party consultant after a long break.
He called me on behalf of Samsung Research and Development Institute of Bangalore. He was
interested in my naukri profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They conducted the test on 18th June. I did just average, some of the testcases
didn&amp;rsquo;t pass TLE :( (I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the time and memory constraints)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Given the set of rod lengths (duplicates are allowed). I need to find two disjoint
subsets with same sum and need to maximize the sum. I just need to output the maximum
sum.
Example:  {1,2,3,4}. The subsets can be {1,3} and {4}; {1,4} and {2,3}. 
Here output should be 5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;They gave me a chance to retake the test on 25th June. This time, I have cleared the test:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Assume Top-left corner as 0,0 and x-axis on horizontal and y-axis vertically.
The input will be the n plot co-ordinates(top left corner and bottom right). Here all
the plots are in rectangle shape and they may share the same edge but there won&#39;t be 
any overlapping area. We need to find the maximum possible square plot size that can 
be formed by these n plots such that
i)    There shouldn&#39;t be any area inside the square which isn&#39;t among the n plots.
ii)   There shouldn&#39;t be any plot such that only a part of it is inside the square.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I got an amazon voucher worth of 5000 for clearing the test and a suprise interview on 29th
June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- Asked me about JS
- OOP
- Implementing Stack using Linked list
- My work experience at previous companies
- Data Structures Stack vs queue, hashmap vs trie, array vs linkedlist ....
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems the JS is mandatory for the role, there are interviewing and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much experience.
I asked the recuriter before the interview about the JD and he didn&amp;rsquo;t shared it and said he too
didn&amp;rsquo;t know. The role I was interviewed is for Voice Intelligence team(I asked the interviewer at
end of interview)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take-aways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should know the JD well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mock Interview (would have improved my performance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
