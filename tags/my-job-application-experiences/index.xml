      <description>Hey,
I have started this blog to log my interview experiences especially after having a break. I had 5 months break in my career. You can find more details about my work experience in another blog. I also found a better way to get referrals and news about job openings in better companies. More about this at the end of this blog.
The order of Interviews I attended:

      <content>&lt;p&gt;Hey,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have started this blog to log my interview experiences especially after having a break. I had 5
months break in my career. You can find more details about my work experience in another blog. I
also found a better way to get referrals and news about job openings in better companies. More about
this at the end of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order of Interviews I attended:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;samsung-research-and-development-institute-of-bangalore&#34;&gt;Samsung Research and Development Institute Of Bangalore:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an entire blog on it, you can find it
&lt;a href=&#34;https://purush7.github.io/posts/samsung_hiring_experience/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;credavenue-yubi&#34;&gt;CredAvenue (Yubi):&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day a staff from &lt;code&gt;intervue.io&lt;/code&gt; contacted me and describe me about the role, asked whether I am
interested or not. He saw my profile on naukri. He scheduled a interview&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;coding-round&#34;&gt;Coding Round:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- Few problems on trees
- I am able to solve it and he asked few questions on trees.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: Passed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recruiter on behalf of yubi scheduled another interview. He mentioned that it will on LLD,
work-experience, coding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;tech-interview&#34;&gt;Tech Interview:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;shardeum&#34;&gt;Shardeum:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly like &lt;code&gt;Yubi&lt;/code&gt;, but this time it is from &lt;code&gt;ultragenius&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Shardeum&lt;/code&gt; is on &lt;code&gt;web3&lt;/code&gt; platform
which I am not interested. As it isn&amp;rsquo;t stable and which help green revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I just want to attend the interview for practise sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;meet-with-ultragenius&#34;&gt;Meet with Ultragenius:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She describe the role and responsbilities. She also gave information about the whole process and
prerequisities needed. I clearly understood, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;meet-with-shardeum&#34;&gt;Meet with Shardeum:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a introductory call from shardeum to explain more about the company and to know my
work-experiences basically more about me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;finboxai&#34;&gt;Finbox.ai:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar fashion,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;coding-interview&#34;&gt;Coding Interview:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Need to arrange the elements in the array according to freq in decreasing order and 
if the freq is same then the order should be similar to orginal order.

input:  [5, 2, 3, 3, 2, 4, 2, -1]
output: [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 4, -1]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I solved it and he asked the time complexity,testcases, test function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;qube-cinemas&#34;&gt;Qube Cinemas:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have applied it on LinkedIn for golang backend role. The recruter sent a mail with the assesment
of deadline 1 week(better to complete ASAP)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assement is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/purush7/challenge2019&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
Solution is in &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt; branch (refer &lt;code&gt;Usage.md&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;platforms&#34;&gt;Platforms:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naukri&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almaconnect (Best as you will get referrals along with the new opening news, also quick hiring
process, you also get the news earlier than naukri and LinkedIn)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>SRIB interview experience</title>

      <description>Hi,
Today, I want to share the whole interview process of SRIB, I went through.
It started in June 2022 with a call from a 3rd party consultant after a long break. He called me on behalf of Samsung Research and Development Institute of Bangalore. He was interested in my naukri profile.
They conducted the test on 18th June. I did just average, some of the testcases didn&amp;rsquo;t pass TLE :( (I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the time and memory constraints)</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to share the whole interview process of SRIB, I went through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started in June 2022 with a call from a 3rd party consultant after a long break.
He called me on behalf of Samsung Research and Development Institute of Bangalore. He was
interested in my naukri profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They conducted the test on 18th June. I did just average, some of the testcases
didn&amp;rsquo;t pass TLE :( (I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the time and memory constraints)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Given the set of rod lengths (duplicates are allowed). I need to find two disjoint
subsets with same sum and need to maximize the sum. I just need to output the maximum
sum.
Example:  {1,2,3,4}. The subsets can be {1,3} and {4}; {1,4} and {2,3}. 
Here output should be 5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;They gave me a chance to retake the test on 25th June. This time, I have cleared the test:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Assume Top-left corner as 0,0 and x-axis on horizontal and y-axis vertically.
The input will be the n plot co-ordinates(top left corner and bottom right). Here all
the plots are in rectangle shape and they may share the same edge but there won&#39;t be 
any overlapping area. We need to find the maximum possible square plot size that can 
be formed by these n plots such that
i)    There shouldn&#39;t be any area inside the square which isn&#39;t among the n plots.
ii)   There shouldn&#39;t be any plot such that only a part of it is inside the square.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I got an amazon voucher worth of 5000 for clearing the test and a suprise interview on 29th
June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- Asked me about JS
- OOP
- Implementing Stack using Linked list
- My work experience at previous companies
- Data Structures Stack vs queue, hashmap vs trie, array vs linkedlist ....
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: Passed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems the JS is mandatory for the role, there are interviewing and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much experience.
I asked the recuriter before the interview about the JD and he didn&amp;rsquo;t shared it and said he too
didn&amp;rsquo;t know. The role I was interviewed is for Voice Intelligence team(I asked the interviewer at
end of interview)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take-aways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should know the JD well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mock Interview (would have improved my performance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then recruiter called me on 30th June and he scheduled a meet on 1st July with HR. I expected the
meet will be on behaviorial,my work experience, discussing about package, and the joining date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- Asked me about my work experiences
- Issues I faced in my prev work
- 3 Toughest challengers I faced in work
- 3 things I liked in my prev company
- My proudest moment in my prev company
- My career goals and interests
- Higher Education
- When can I join?
- Expected package?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: Passed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems it went well, atleast I am statisfied with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the recruiter called me on 4th July and scheduled an interview with &lt;code&gt;Voice Intelligence&lt;/code&gt;
Team Director on 5th July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- Asked about my work experiences
- My interests and domain I like
- Describe the role and the responsibilities
- He thought my interests won&#39;t allign with the role and said he will let me know  
after some internal discussion with the team.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally I was &lt;code&gt;ghosted&lt;/code&gt;. The recruiter should have shared the JD and he should have given the choice
as there are many teams which are hiring inside SRIB. Thanks to the recruiter, now I am not able to
reach them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</content>
